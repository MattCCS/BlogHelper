    - "\x01" = chr(1)
- pip installing from github
- "-e" vs. not -> why? what happens re. directory + venv/pip freeze? uses

    Project Ideas:
    - wrapper for "".find("") that returns the line -> x.findline("") ?


( GIT )
- when to pull vs. rebase
- rebases don't move tags


( SILLY )
- "OEIS compression" / Kolmogorov
- "CS Cocktails"
