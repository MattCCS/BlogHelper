Generating K Unique Pseudo-Random Integers -- in Constant Space and Time!

In the following (lengthy and slightly mathy) post, I outline a clever technique for generating unique integers in a given range.

More interestingly, however, we will do this with <strong>constant</strong> space/time requirements by exploiting a cool property of prime numbers.

Generating random numbers is a relatively simple task.  It can be done extremely quickly and with absolutely minimal memory requirements.  This is due in large part to the fact that the phrase "random number" really does not imply any requirements.

Note that in this very basic explanation we are specifically <em>not</em> referring to "cryptographically-secure random numbers", which instead have extremely strict requirements concerning their predictablility and distribution.
